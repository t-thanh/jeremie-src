Here are the the different packages needed to run the program.

Code detection uses OpenCV to detect ArUco codes 
Filter contains 2 packages : 
	A package tfe_msgs that contains my custom message
	Global pose caluclator that calculates the position of the aruco code in the 3D world.
Prediction contains the code to use the BÃ©zier predictor 

To run all the nodes : 

rosrun code_detection Aruco_detection
rosrun global_pose_calculator Global_pose_publisher.py
rosrun bezier_predictor Predictor.py
